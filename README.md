This is a simple html & css vertical timeline to use as a template. It's proportionate to the around of time passed, and there are three units in css that control the height of the div:

`.day-span {
  height: 1rem;
}`

`.week-span {
  height: calc(1 * 7rem);
}`

`.month-span {
    height: calc(1 * 30rem);
}`
